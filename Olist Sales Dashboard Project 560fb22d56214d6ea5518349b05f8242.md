## Dashboard

## Metrics and Dimensions

- **Total Orders**: The total number of individual purchase transactions completed within a specific period.
- **Gross Revenue**: The total amount of money generated from sales before any deductions like discounts, returns, or taxes.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: The average amount spent per transaction.
- **Average Basket Size**: The average number of items purchased per order.
- **Order Cancellation Rate**: The percentage of orders that are canceled compared to the total number of orders placed.

## Sales Dashboard Insights Summary

- **Sales Performance:**
    - **Trend Analysis**: Evaluate how Total Orders and Gross Revenue have changed month-over-month. This helps identify growth trends or declines in sales performance.
    - **Revenue per Order**: Compare Gross Revenue with Total Orders to see if revenue growth aligns with order growth or if revenue per order is fluctuating.

    - **Hour of the Day**: Determine peak shopping hours. This can assist in scheduling promotions and improving website performance during high-traffic times.
- **Customer Spending Behavior:**
    - **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Analyze how AOV trends over time. A rising AOV suggests that customers are spending more per transaction, while a declining AOV could indicate reduced spending or promotions affecting spending behavior.
    - **Average Basket Size**: Assess changes in Average Basket Size to understand if customers are buying more items per order. This can indicate whether your upselling or cross-selling strategies are effective.
- **Order Fulfillment Efficiency:**
    - **Order Cancellation Rate**: High cancellation rates may indicate issues with order fulfillment, customer satisfaction, or potential problems with the purchasing process.
